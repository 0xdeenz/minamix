## Disclaimers
In case of an investigation by any federal entity or similar, this is a simple software project of academic purposes aimed to explore the applications of zero knowledge proofs and expand on their use cases. The code will be released under an MIT license and as such authors cannot be legally liable for any misapropriate use. The autonomous smart contracts (that could not qualify as a legal person) will only be deployed on test networks with **FAKE** funds, and will only be used to test that they work as per the technical specifications, and not to any other end.
